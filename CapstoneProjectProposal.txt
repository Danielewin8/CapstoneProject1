CAPSTONE PROJECT PROPOSAL.

1.What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
	I hope to create an app that allows users who are looking for people to play specific games with an avenue to find friends.

2.What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
	Gamers!

3.What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
	I plan to use an api that can return information and descriptions on specific games. There is one I have found called RAWG, which claims to be the largest video game database and game discovery service.

4.In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
	a. What does your database schema look like?
My database would include potential tables for users(including ids, names, game genres they are interested in, etc), a games table(inluding ids, names of games, and what genre they belong to, which would in turn relate to users!)
	b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
Being able to distinguish and relay correct information regarding genres and suggested games in accordance with those genres will probably be tricky. Recommendations in general whether it is for games or potential friends is something I don't think I have done much of yet, so I think that will be a challenge.
	c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
I hope to be able to provide means for a user to give info on what platforms they play on, what their usernames for said platforms would be, so that will have a form of security. Maybe after finding another player and discussing times and games to play, then that can be shared? Besides that will need authentication just for the users on the site in general so they can log in and maintain a profile.
	d. What functionality will your app include?
I want my app to allow users to create profiles. This should include info on: Their name or prefered name and other basic info, what games they play, what games they are interested in, what genres of games they like, what platforms they play games on, what times they are available to play, and maybe what their goals or interests are for said games.
	e. What will the user flow look like?
I'd like it be relatively simple for a user to be logged in, and have their profile page, and then like a home page to then see a list perhaps, or maybe one profile of another user at a time that has similar interests as them. Then to be able to contact or match with that user somehow.
	f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?
There are a lot of things I believe could be included in this app that would challenge me and involve more then CRUD that I haven't worked on specifically before. Such as a recommendation system, or a means to chat with another user. These systems I will try my best to incorporate.
